Otherwise, itтАЩs just making things up. You denying RahuтАЩs significance as a key planet of destiny/karma goes against basic definitions of the planetтАЩs function. https://t.co/YZ5dxmfnbW

Everybody dies yeah its a fact but to speak negative on the dead idk maybe its just the way I was raised or maybe I have more respect than some do, maybe its superstition. To each their own
